# TDDFUNDAMENTALS
In this project, I will use test-driven development to build a factorial method. I will use the assert module and mocha testing library to drive your development using tests that follow the phases: setup, exercise, and verification.



The steps below follow the red-green-refactor cycle and will guide you through the process of using test-driven development to create a factorial method. The factorial method will be inside an object named Calculate. I will be implementing your test code in the file index_test.js, and your implementation code in index.js.
